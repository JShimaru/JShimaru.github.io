//Story So Far...

Welcome to Ty Kali, a world filled with magic and wonder! The people
of this world travel to various realms to develop their greatest power,  
the power of spells and words. As a "Script-in-training" you are headed
for the "Kore Reactor", an ancient item used to unlock latent knowledge.

The journey to the Kore Reactor will be filled with peril and challenges
but if you persist you will leave with abilities greater than those of
which you had came. Abilities provided only to those who are willing to
journey into the dark and arise from the ashes like a Phoenix.

Your search begins on the shores of a beach, bright and beautiful. With
such a gorgeous view there's no way anything could go wrong... Right?

//Modes

Story: Play through the original story of T.K. Phoenix!

VS: Two player battle mode.

Challenge: Time-based challenges with words from various categories.
